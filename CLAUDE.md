## Project Rules

- **Never push to main** - Create feature branches, merge via PR. Use the rsid (recursive self-improving development) skill to learn how to get your code merged to main.
- **Write high quality plans** - Use the plan-writing skill to learn how to plan effectively.
- **Write high quality code** - use the coding-loop, coding-patterns, error-handling, typescript-coding, pull-request, env-patterns, effective-git skills to learn how to master various aspects of the coding lifecycle.
- **`./verify.sh --ui=false` must pass** before PR merge. Use the verification-pipeline skill to learn more about how to verify your changes.
- **Use devcontainer for isolation** - Use the devcontainer-sandboxing skill for secure container-based development.
