# Meta-Instruction Feedback

This document collects feedback on the meta-instructions themselves (depth 2). These cannot be changed via the normal IP process - they require human review.

## How to Use This Document

When you observe issues with the self-improvement protocol itself:

1. Do NOT create an IP (depth 2 is human-owned)
2. Append feedback to this document
3. Continue with your work
4. Human will review periodically and update meta-instructions if warranted

## Feedback Template

```markdown
## Feedback: {brief title}

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Session**: Milestone or session identifier
**Observation**: What you noticed about the meta-instructions
**Suggestion**: How it might be improved (optional)
```
