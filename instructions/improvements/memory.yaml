    date: "2025-12-15"
    context: |
      Added vitest.config.ts files to 5 port packages that had tests but were
      missing coverage configuration. This enforces 100% test coverage thresholds
      across all testable packages.

        summary: "Port packages with tests need vitest.config.ts with 100% coverage"
        detail: |
          Every port package that has tests (*.test.ts files) should have its own
          vitest.config.ts that enforces 100% coverage thresholds:
          - lines: 100
          - functions: 100
          - branches: 100
          - statements: 100

          Template:
          ```typescript
          import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

          export default defineConfig({
            test: {
              coverage: {
                provider: 'v8',
                reporter: ['text', 'lcov'],
                include: ['src/**/*.ts'],
                exclude: ['src/**/*.test.ts'],
                thresholds: {
                  lines: 100,
                  functions: 100,
                  branches: 100,
                  statements: 100,
                },
              },
            },
          });
          ```

        summary: "Find test files first, then check for missing vitest configs"
        detail: |
          When auditing test coverage configs:
          1. Find all test files: `find packages -name "*.test.ts"`
          2. Find all vitest configs: `packages/*/vitest.config.ts`
          3. Diff to find packages with tests but no config

          This task found 6 packages with tests but only 1 had a vitest config.

        summary: "git reset --hard origin/main to resolve divergent branches"
        detail: |
          When local main diverges from origin/main after a PR merge (because
          local had unpushed commits that got squashed into the PR), use:

          ```bash
          git reset --hard origin/main
          ```

          This discards the local unpushed commits and aligns with the merged state.

    date: "2025-12-15"
    context: |
      Upgraded vitest from ^2.1.8/^3.0.4 to ^4.0.15 across 8 packages. Also updated
      @vitest/coverage-v8 to match. Major version bump from v2/v3 to v4 worked
      smoothly with no breaking changes in test code.

        detail: |
          When npm view fails due to cache permission errors:
          ```
          npm error Your cache folder contains root-owned files...
          ```

          Use curl directly to the npm registry instead:
          ```bash
          curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/vitest/latest | grep -o '"version":"[^"]*"'
          ```

          This bypasses the local npm cache entirely.

        summary: "Keep @vitest/coverage-v8 version in sync with vitest"
        detail: |
          When updating vitest, ensure @vitest/coverage-v8 is updated to the same
          version. These packages are released together and should match.

          Before: vitest ^3.0.4, @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.0.4
          After:  vitest ^4.0.15, @vitest/coverage-v8 ^4.0.15

      - type: "insight"
        summary: "Major vitest upgrades (2→4) work smoothly for basic test setups"
        detail: |
          Vitest major version upgrades from v2/v3 to v4 required no changes to test
          code. The 242 tests across 8 packages all passed without modification.
          This suggests vitest maintains good backwards compatibility for standard
          test patterns (describe, it, expect, vi.fn, vi.spyOn).
