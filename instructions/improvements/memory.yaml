    date: "2025-12-15"
    context: |
      Added vitest.config.ts files to 5 port packages that had tests but were
      missing coverage configuration. This enforces 100% test coverage thresholds
      across all testable packages.

          Every port package that has tests (*.test.ts files) should have its own
          vitest.config.ts that enforces 100% coverage thresholds:
          - lines: 100
          - functions: 100
          - branches: 100
          - statements: 100

          ```typescript
          import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

          export default defineConfig({
            test: {
              coverage: {

        detail: |
          When auditing test coverage configs:
          1. Find all test files: `find packages -name "*.test.ts"`
          2. Find all vitest configs: `packages/*/vitest.config.ts`
          3. Diff to find packages with tests but no config

          This task found 6 packages with tests but only 1 had a vitest config.

        detail: |
          When local main diverges from origin/main after a PR merge (because
          local had unpushed commits that got squashed into the PR), use:

          ```bash
          git reset --hard origin/main
          ```

          This discards the local unpushed commits and aligns with the merged state.

      Upgraded vitest from ^2.1.8/^3.0.4 to ^4.0.15 across 8 packages. Also updated
      @vitest/coverage-v8 to match. Major version bump from v2/v3 to v4 worked
      smoothly with no breaking changes in test code.

          ```
          npm error Your cache folder contains root-owned files...
          ```

          Use curl directly to the npm registry instead:
          ```bash
          curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/vitest/latest | grep -o '"version":"[^"]*"'
          ```

          This bypasses the local npm cache entirely.

        detail: |
          When updating vitest, ensure @vitest/coverage-v8 is updated to the same
          version. These packages are released together and should match.

          Before: vitest ^3.0.4, @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.0.4
          After:  vitest ^4.0.15, @vitest/coverage-v8 ^4.0.15

        summary: "Major vitest upgrades (2→4) work smoothly for basic test setups"
        detail: |
          Vitest major version upgrades from v2/v3 to v4 required no changes to test
          code. The 242 tests across 8 packages all passed without modification.
          This suggests vitest maintains good backwards compatibility for standard
          test patterns (describe, it, expect, vi.fn, vi.spyOn).

    date: "2025-12-15"
    context: |
      Added a new "doctor" stage to the verification pipeline that applies
      auto-corrections. First doctor step uses knip to detect unused dependencies.
      Learned important lessons about knip configuration and package-lock.json stability.

          WRONG: `knip --fix` - removes all unused exports, breaking the codebase
          RIGHT: `knip --fix --dependencies` - only handles dependency issues

          By default, knip --fix removes unused exports across the codebase, which
          can break intentionally exported APIs. Use --dependencies flag to limit
          scope to dependency issues only.

        detail: |
          knip is a validation concern, not a project-wide tooling concern.
          Placing it in apps/validation-pipeline/package.json keeps responsibilities
          clear. The knip.json config file stays at root to scan the whole monorepo.

        detail: |
          When vitest types break (e.g., ".not does not exist on Assertion<T>"),
          the issue is often a package-lock.json mismatch. Fix by:

          ```bash
          rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
          git checkout main -- package-lock.json
          npm install
          ```

          This restores the known-good dependency resolution from main.

  - task: "feat/control-flow-package"
    date: "2025-12-15"
    context: |
      Implemented control flow primitives as two packages: contract-control-flow (pure types)
      and port-control-flow (runtime implementations). Initial implementation had runtime code
      in the contract package, which violated coding-patterns skill guidance. Restructured to
      properly separate concerns.
    learnings:
      - type: "misconception"
        summary: "Contract packages must have NO runtime code - not even error classes"
        detail: |
          WRONG: Putting error classes, helper functions, constants in contract packages
          RIGHT: Contracts contain ONLY TypeScript types, interfaces, type aliases

          The initial contract-control-flow had:
          - Classes (ConveauxError, FetchError, etc.)
          - Functions (ok, err, map, computeRetryDelay, etc.)
          - Constants (DEFAULT_RETRY_METADATA, EXIT_SUCCESS, etc.)

          All of these emit JavaScript and belong in the PORT package, not the contract.

          The rule from coding-patterns: "If it emits JavaScript, it doesn't belong in a contract."

      - type: "pattern"
        summary: "Use 'declare const' for symbols in contracts to define type without value"
        detail: |
          When a contract needs to reference a symbol (like EXIT_CODE), use TypeScript's
          ambient declaration syntax:

          ```typescript
          // In contract (no runtime value)
          export declare const EXIT_CODE: unique symbol;

          // In port (actual runtime value)
          export const EXIT_CODE: typeof import('@conveaux/contract-control-flow').EXIT_CODE =
            Symbol.for('conveaux.exitCode') as typeof import('@conveaux/contract-control-flow').EXIT_CODE;
          ```

          This allows the contract to define the type while the port provides the implementation.

      - type: "pattern"
        summary: "Use timestamps (number) instead of Date objects in contracts"
        detail: |
          WRONG: `retryAfter?: Date` - requires Date constructor, not hermetic
          RIGHT: `retryAfterMs?: number` - pure data, no runtime dependencies

          For FetchError.rateLimited(), accept the timestamp directly:
          ```typescript
          static rateLimited(retryAfterMs?: number): FetchError
          ```

          Callers with access to a clock port compute: `nowMs + delaySeconds * 1000`
          This keeps the contract hermetic (no global Date usage).

          - Security (no secrets, injection risks)
          - Correctness (logic verification, edge cases)
          - Maintainability (readability, test coverage)
          - Type safety (no any types)

          Verdict was APPROVED with no blockers. This demonstrates the subagent
          can handle rigorous PR review autonomously as required by coding-loop skill.

  - task: "feat/consolidate-error-into-control-flow"
    date: "2025-12-15"
    context: |
      Consolidated @conveaux/contract-error package into @conveaux/port-control-flow.
      The port-control-flow package already had enhanced versions of all error classes
      with intrinsic exit codes and retry metadata, making contract-error redundant.
    learnings:
      - type: "pattern"
        summary: "When consolidating, check for API signature differences"
        detail: |
          The FetchError constructor changed from positional to options object:

          OLD (contract-error): new FetchError(message, statusCode)
          NEW (port-control-flow): new FetchError(message, { statusCode: number })

          All call sites must be updated when migrating to a new API. Search for
          all usages before starting the migration.

        summary: "Abstract base classes still work for instanceof checks"
        detail: |
          ConveauxError changed from a concrete class to an abstract class in
          port-control-flow. The CLI uses `instanceof ConveauxError` to catch
          all domain errors. This still works because:
          1. All concrete error subclasses extend ConveauxError
          2. The prototype chain is properly set with Object.setPrototypeOf

          Abstract classes can serve as instanceof targets for their subclasses.

        summary: "When to consolidate vs keep separate packages"
        detail: |
          Q: When should packages be consolidated?
          A: Consolidate when:
          - One package is a strict superset of another (port-control-flow had
            enhanced versions of all contract-error classes)
          - The separate package adds no unique value
          - Consolidation simplifies the dependency graph

          Keep separate when:
          - Packages serve different purposes (contract vs port)
          - Different consumers need different subsets
          - Circular dependency risk exists

      - type: "insight"
        summary: "Exit codes could improve CLI error handling"
        detail: |
          The tsc-reviewer noted that the CLI could leverage ConveauxError.exitCode
          instead of always using process.exit(1):

          ```typescript
          if (error instanceof ConveauxError) {
            logger.error(error.message, { error });
            process.exit(error.exitCode); // 1=system, 2=user, 3=retryable
          }
          ```

          This is a follow-up improvement opportunity - not part of this refactor.

  - task: "feat/logger-color-config"
    date: "2025-12-15"
    context: |
      Replaced the simple `colors: true/false` API in createPrettyFormatter with a
      flexible color configuration system supporting themes, per-level customization,
      and NO_COLOR/FORCE_COLOR environment variables. Followed contract-port separation.
    learnings:
      - type: "pattern"
        summary: "FORCE_COLOR must be checked before NO_COLOR in resolution order"
        detail: |
          The color resolution order matters. Initial implementation checked NO_COLOR
          before FORCE_COLOR, which meant forceColor couldn't override NO_COLOR.

          WRONG order:
          1. Check NO_COLOR → disable
          2. Check FORCE_COLOR → enable (never reached if NO_COLOR set)

          RIGHT order:
          1. enabled: false → disable
          2. FORCE_COLOR → enable (overrides NO_COLOR)
          3. NO_COLOR → disable
          4. enabled: true → enable
          5. Default → enable

          The key insight: FORCE_COLOR is meant to OVERRIDE NO_COLOR, so it must be
          checked first in the resolution chain.

        summary: "Injectable ColorEnvironment for testable NO_COLOR detection"
        detail: |
          Instead of reading process.env directly, inject an environment detector:

          interface ColorEnvironment {
            isNoColorSet: () => boolean;
            isForceColorSet: () => boolean;
            supportsColor: () => boolean;

            isTTY?: () => boolean;
          }): ColorEnvironment
          ```

          This allows tests to inject mock environments without touching process.env:
          ```typescript
          const env = createColorEnvironment({
            getEnv: (name) => name === 'NO_COLOR' ? '1' : undefined,
          });
          ```

        summary: "Use discriminated unions for color specifications"
        detail: |
          For a ColorSpec that can be named colors, 256-color, RGB, or hex:

          ```typescript
          type Ansi256Color = { readonly type: '256'; readonly index: number };
          type RgbColor = { readonly type: 'rgb'; readonly r: number; readonly g: number; readonly b: number };

          type ColorSpec = AnsiColorName | Ansi256Color | RgbColor | HexColor;
          ```

          The `type` discriminant allows type-safe handling:
          ```typescript
          if (typeof spec === 'string') { /* named color */ }
          else if (spec.type === '256') { /* 256-color */ }
          else if (spec.type === 'rgb') { /* RGB */ }

          Invoking the plan-writing skill before implementation led to:
          - Clear type hierarchy (ColorSpec, StyleDefinition, LoggerTheme, ColorConfig)
          - Proper backward compatibility design (colors: boolean still works)
          - Well-defined resolution order for color enablement
          - Comprehensive test coverage plan

          The "distinguished engineers reviewing" framing helps catch API design
          issues before implementation.

      - type: "pattern"
        summary: "Export ANSI constants for app-level color consistency"
        detail: |
          Export ANSI constants from port-logger so apps don't duplicate them:

          ```typescript
          export const ANSI_COLORS: Record<AnsiColorName, string> = { ... };
          export const ANSI_BG_COLORS: Record<AnsiColorName, string> = { ... };
          export const ANSI_STYLES: Record<AnsiStyle, string> = { ... };
          export const ANSI_RESET = '\x1b[0m';
          ```

          Apps can then import and use consistent color codes:
          ```typescript
          import { ANSI_COLORS, ANSI_RESET } from '@conveaux/port-logger';
          console.log(`${ANSI_COLORS.blue}message${ANSI_RESET}`);
          ```

          This eliminates duplicate ANSI code definitions across the codebase.
