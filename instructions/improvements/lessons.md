# Lessons Learned

This document accumulates wisdom from development sessions. Each lesson is indexed by domain for retrieval.

## How to Use This Document

1. **During Bootstrap**: Scan recent lessons in domains relevant to current work
2. **After Learning**: Add new lessons with full context
3. **Pattern Recognition**: When 3+ similar lessons exist, consider creating an IP to formalize

## Index

| Domain | Count | Last Updated |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| (none yet) | 0 | - |
